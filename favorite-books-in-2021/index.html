    <p>Now that we are done with 2021, it is time to list some of my favorite books from last year.</p>
<p>Overall, 2021 was somewhat &ldquo;meh&rdquo; with respect to how much I was able to read. I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/25336627">61</a> books, which is quite a bit lower from previous years (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19560079">73</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/15055253">100</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10278563">94</a>). In addition, I wasn&rsquo;t able to read as much non-fiction as I wanted. Hopefully 2022 turns out to be a better year.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite books:</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202">Project Hail Mary, <em>by Andy Weir</em></a> A very interesting and fun read. Almost as good as <em>The Martian</em> (which is one of my all time favorites). A high school teacher wakes up in a star system with no knowledge of how he got there. He can&rsquo;t remember his name nor the nature of his mission. The story is about he uses his wits, science, and engineering to save the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45754981-the-glass-hotel">The Glass Hotel, <em>by Emily St. John Mandel</em></a> Another book by an author who wrote one of my favorite books, <em>Station Eleven</em>. In a similar style, <em>The Glass Hotel</em> starts with several disparate stories and ties them all together in a beautiful and amazing web. I listened to the audiobook narration, and <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Glass-Hotel-Audiobook/0525596682">Dylan Moore</a> does an amazing job bringing the story to life with her voice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora">Diaspora, <em>by Greg Egan</em></a> This is my first <em>Greg Egan</em> book, and wow. Hard Sci-Fi through and through, and one of the densest books that I&rsquo;ve read. The author invented new branches of physics for the story-telling, and at times I barely understood big chunks of it. The book and its ideas were really interested though, and I look forward to reading more of <em>Greg</em>&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51807232-troubled-blood">Troubled Blood, <em>by Robert Galbraith</em></a> Ever since I read <em>Agatha Christie</em> as a kid, I have a penchant for British crime thrillers. This was the fifth book in the <em>Cormoran Strike</em> series and at 947 pages, was the longest book I read this year. However, I was so engrossed in the story that I barely noticed the length. I continue to dig the novels written by <em>Robert Galbraith</em> (pen-name used by <em>J. K. Rowling</em>), and look forward to the next one in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45422268-the-vanished-birds">The Vanished Birds, <em>by Simon Jimenez</em></a> I started it based on a friend&rsquo;s recommendation and wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. A beautifully written Sci-Fi book that deals with the relationships and connections between people across time and space.</p>
<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win, <em>by Jocko Willink</em></a> This book had been on my to-read list for a long time, and came highly recommended from many sources. Amazing book, and I regret not reading it sooner. Clear and easy to read, with key lessons that stayed with me and helped me become a better leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968118-the-code-breaker">The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race, <em>by Walter Isaacson</em></a> As soon as I found out that Walter Isaacson was writing his next book about Jennifer Doudna, I had to immediately preorder the book. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. The book tells <em>Doudna</em>&rsquo;s life story, and simultaneously tells the story of discovery of CRISPR. Like many nobel-winning disoveries, the story had its share of intrigue and rivalry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation">Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, <em>by Anna Lembke</em></a> Eye-opening book that goes into details of how much the world around us is built to provide access to high-dopamine stimuli (which lead to additions), and what we can do about it. For instance, I highly recommend pairing this book with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU">Dopamine Masterclass</a> podcast by <em>Andrew Huberman</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58188742-how-to-live">How to Live: 27 Conflicting Answers and One Weird Conclusion, <em>by Derek Sivers</em></a> Thought provoking. The book provides several perspectives on how to live, and opens your mind to various possibilities that we tend to ignore in our day-to-day. I found it helpful as it let me take a step back and consider different possibilities from my trajectory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52908942-how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster">How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, <em>by Bill Gates</em></a> This book distills what Bill has learned in more than a decade of studying climate change and investing in innovations. While there may be better books that describe the science of Climate change, this book does a great job at breaking Climate Change into several different causes (backed by data), with concrete actions that we could do to address each cause.</p>
