      <title>Event Driven Architecture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) &lt;em&gt;uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled nodes (services)&lt;/em&gt;Â within the system. Producers generate initiating events (messages) when a significant change in state occurs. Components within the system subscribe to events and react to them by performing specific actions or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), also known as, Service-Based Architecture (SBA), is a distributed architecture pattern in which an application is organized into a collection of loosely coupled, reusable &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt;. Each service is a self-contained unit that performs a specific task or function, and communicates with other services using standard communication protocols, such as REST, SOAP, or gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A pipeline architecture is a monolithic architecture style, which means a single deployment unit for all of the code. The essential characteristic of pipeline architecture is that data or tasks are processed in a series of stages. Each stage receives the output from the previous stage, processes it, and passes it on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Layered Architecture is a monolithic architecture style, which means a single deployment unit for all the code. This style is also known as the &lt;em&gt;n-tiered&lt;/em&gt; architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software architecture is very context-dependent. Factors such as the software application&amp;rsquo;s goals, the development team&amp;rsquo;s size and budget, and business needs play a significant role in the choice of software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
